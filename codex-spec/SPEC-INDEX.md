# Numbers Codex Implementation Specification

This directory contains the complete normative behavioral kernel
required for backend implementation.

The following folders define the system:

- core/ — state machine and invariants
- data/ — canonical records and restart semantics
- bidding/ — bid admission and settlement
- errors/ — error classification and escalation
- config/ — complete configuration surface
- api/ — external interface shapes and rules

No document outside this directory is authoritative for implementation.
