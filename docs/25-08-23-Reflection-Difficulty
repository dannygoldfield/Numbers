# AI, Learning, and the Difficulty of Numbers

## Reflection
Progress feels slow, but the reality is that each step forward in **Numbers** is proof of learning.  
Without ChatGPT (and emerging AI tools), taking on this project would have been close to impossible.  
AI acts as a co-pilot: accelerating progress while leaving the hard thinking and decisions to you.

## How AI Accelerates Development
1. **Turbocharging Productivity**  
   Studies show AI coding assistants speed up development tasks by ~55%.  
   They handle scaffolding, configs, and debugging—freeing time for design and testing.

2. **Boosting Learning & Higher-Order Thinking**  
   Research finds AI improves STEM learning outcomes and supports higher-order reasoning.

3. **Shifting Workflows — “Vibe Coding”**  
   Natural-language prompting changes how engineers build, focusing more on creative logic than syntax.

4. **A Tool, Not a Crutch**  
   Leaders stress: AI should amplify, not replace developers. Over-reliance risks skipping foundational skills.

## Numbers Project — Difficulty Map

**Overall Rating**  
- **Alpha (Testnet, simulated payments/UI): 6.5 / 10**  
- **Launch (Mainnet, multi-user, live BTC payments): 8 / 10**

**By Module (Alpha / Launch):**
- Wallet: 5.5 / 7.5 → RPC quirks, key security.
- Auction: 6.5 / 8 → timing, fairness, persistence.
- Inscribe: 6 / 9 → Ordinals, satpoints, reorgs.
- Payment: 4 / 8 → confirmations, refunds, double-spend risk.
- Settle: 5 / 8.5 → finalization, idempotency, replay safety.
- Website: 6 / 7 → real-time UI, multi-user state.

**Cross-cutting:**  
- Index (JSON → SQLite): 5 / 7.5  
- Observability & Logs: 4 / 6.5  
- CI / Safety Net: 5.5 / 6
