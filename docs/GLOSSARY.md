# Glossary

This glossary defines terms used elsewhere in the project.  
Definitions are descriptive, not binding.

## Auction
A fixed-duration process in which bids may be placed for the next number in the sequence.

## Bitcoin
The Bitcoin network and blockchain used as the settlement and recording layer for Numbers.

## Inscription
Data embedded in a Bitcoin transaction using the Ordinals protocol.  
In Numbers, the inscription content is the number itself.  
Only inscriptions produced by the Numbers system are treated as system-recognized outcomes.

## Null Steward
A designated destination used when an auction resolves without a winning bid.  
It ensures the sequence advances without retry.

## Number
An integer in the sequential series starting at 1.  
Each number is auctioned exactly once.

## Ordinals
A protocol that assigns identifiers to individual satoshis and enables inscriptions to be associated with them.

## Satoshi
The smallest unit of Bitcoin.

## Satpoint
A reference that identifies a specific satoshi within a specific transaction output.

## Settlement
The resolution of an auction, including determination of the destination for the inscription.

## System-Recognized
An outcome, record, or inscription that the Numbers system designates  
as the authoritative result for a given auction number.  
There is exactly one system-recognized outcome per number.

## Viewer-Determined Rendering
A property of Numbers in which the appearance of the number is defined by the viewing environment, not by the system.
