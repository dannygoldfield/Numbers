# Is this a Joke?

Yes.

**Numbers** begins as a joke in the ordinary sense:
an absurd question taken seriously.

But for the joke to work: 
1. it cannot live in the system. 
2. the technology must be exact.
3. the rules must be strict.
4. the outcomes must be irreversible.

Nothing in the protocol acknowledges the joke.

The system asserts nothing beyond the outcome.
