# Non-Requirements — Numbers

This document defines what Numbers explicitly does **not** do.

It is normative.

Any behavior not listed here but implied elsewhere must be treated as a bug
or a misunderstanding of the system.

If a feature appears useful but conflicts with this document,
this document takes precedence.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- Prevent scope creep
- Prevent reinterpretation over time
- Prevent accidental authority expansion
- Make “no” explicit and durable

Non-requirements are as binding as requirements.

---

## 2. Ownership and Meaning

Numbers does not:

- Define what it means to “own” a number
- Guarantee exclusivity beyond recorded outcomes
- Interpret inscriptions as property, rights, or claims
- Enforce social, legal, or economic meaning

Numbers records outcomes.
Meaning is external.

---

## 3. Valuation and Market Behavior

Numbers does not:

- Rank numbers
- Assign rarity
- Suggest value
- Optimize price discovery
- Provide pricing analytics
- Encourage bidding behavior

Any value judgment is external to the system.

---

## 4. User Identity and Accounts

Numbers does not:

- Create user accounts
- Maintain user profiles
- Authenticate bidders beyond protocol requirements
- Track bidder reputation
- Link bids across auctions

Bids are evaluated in isolation.

---

## 5. Guarantees and Certainty

Numbers does not:

- Guarantee inscription success
- Guarantee broadcast finality
- Repair ambiguity through time
- Retry irreversible actions automatically
- Override uncertainty through operator action

Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

---

## 6. Blockchain Extensions

Numbers does not:

- Modify Bitcoin consensus rules
- Extend the Ordinals protocol
- Introduce new token standards
- Create sidechains or L2 dependencies
- Require nonstandard Bitcoin software

Numbers uses existing primitives only.

---

## 7. Automation and Optimization

Numbers does not:

- Optimize throughput
- Maximize auction velocity
- Batch auctions for efficiency
- Parallelize authority-bearing actions
- Trade safety for liveness

Correctness is preferred over speed.

---

## 8. Recovery and Rewriting

Numbers does not:

- Rewrite history
- Roll back finalized states
- Merge conflicting outcomes
- Repair partial authority loss
- Resolve ambiguity heuristically

History is append-only.

---

## 9. Governance and Intervention

Numbers does not:

- Provide governance mechanisms
- Allow voting on outcomes
- Permit manual overrides
- Support discretionary intervention

Operators have no special authority.

---

## 10. Future Compatibility

Numbers does not promise:

- Backward compatibility with speculative features
- Support for unforeseen interpretations
- Alignment with future cultural norms

Only documented behavior is supported.

---

## 11. Final Rule

If a behavior is not explicitly required,
assume it is **not supported**.
