### **Yesterday (Penpot Components)**

* **Accomplished:**

  * Built the **Key** component (individual button with number/character).
  * Built the **Keyboard** component (two rows, numbers + dot + backspace).
  * Wrestled with **flex layouts** (Row vs Row-Reverse, Justify Content). Learned how Penpot handles alignment.
  * Confirmed how to make **Components** (diamond icons) and the difference between **Groups** and **Frames** in practice. And that "Frames" is not a term used in Penpot. 
  * Workflow for building Components is more clear.

* **Learned:**

  * Layout alignment needs to be verified before creating Components (otherwise tedious fixes later).
  * **Row direction + naming consistency** matter for intuitive order.
  * Penpot undo is limited → careful sequencing saves time.
  * Components are reusable but require **clean setup of instances** before conversion.

### **Today’s Plan (7 hrs)**

**Goal: Build the core UI Components needed for Alpha demo.**

1. **Auction Card (3 hrs)**

   * Layout: number, timer, current bid.
   * Use Key and Keyboard as references for spacing/alignment discipline.
   * Make it a Component → this will be the central piece of the UI.

2. **Input Field (1.5 hrs)**

   * Basic text entry box for bid amount.
   * Keep minimal (system default look).
   * Turn into Component.

3. **Action Buttons (1 hr)**

   * Submit / Cancel. Do we need a cancel option or user just backspaces to remove bid? Map out the User experience. What do we want to be intuitive and also interrogate for possible edge cases?
   * Style consistent with Key component (board + text).

4. **Status/Message Banner (1 hr)**

   * Lightweight component for feedback messages.
   * Error, Success, Info. color palette?

5. **Buffer/Refactor (0.5 hr)**

   * Review all components.
   * Check naming, alignment, and hierarchy cleanliness.

⚠️ **Rule for today**: Don’t get stuck 8 hours on a single component. If one eats more than double its budget, freeze progress, document the issue, and move to the next.

Want me to also rank which of these could be *cut* without breaking the Sept 2 Alpha goal, so you have a fallback if you only finish part of the list?
