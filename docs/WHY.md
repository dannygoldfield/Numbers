# Why — Numbers

This document explains why Numbers exists.

It is **non-normative**.

It defines no behavior, grants no authority, and introduces no requirements.
If there is any conflict, all normative specification documents take precedence.

---

## Premise

There are systems that operate without a central authority.

- Public blockchains record irreversible outcomes.
- Numbers circulate freely across cultures.

Numbers combines these two facts.

It applies an irreversible record to a number.

Nothing more.

## What This Document Does Not Do

This document does **not** define or assert:

- ownership
- rights
- value
- enforcement
- guarantees

No claim is made that a number can be owned.

## Framing Only

Numbers does not assert ownership.
Numbers does not confer ownership.
Numbers does not define ownership.

The system records outcomes.
Any meaning attributed to those outcomes is external.

---

## Scope Boundary

This document exists to explain **why the system exists**, not **how it works**.

All system behavior is defined elsewhere.
This document must not be used to infer rules or semantics.
