# Target Audience Archetype — Numbers Project

## Short Bio

**Alex** is a 32-year-old software engineer and early Bitcoin adopter living in Brooklyn. Curious, technically fluent, and culturally playful, Alex thrives at the intersection of crypto infrastructure and conceptual art. They already use Ordinals-enabled wallets, enjoy experimental auctions, and value the cultural cachet of being “in early.” For Alex, owning a number on Bitcoin is both a proof of participation and a piece of enduring digital art.

## Archetype Bio — “The Collector of the Immutable”

**Name:** Alex (gender-neutral stand-in)  
**Age:** 32  
**Location:** Brooklyn, NY (could also be Berlin, Lisbon, or Singapore — global crypto hubs)  
**Background:** Computer science undergrad with a minor in art history. Works remotely in software (web3 infra, security, or product).  

**Financial Profile:**  
- Bitcoin holder since ~2016.  
- Hardware wallet user, comfortable experimenting on Testnet.  
- Willing to risk small sums on experimental projects but cautious with larger stakes.  

**Psychology:**  
- Sees themselves as an *early identifier of cultural primitives* (CryptoPunks, early NFTs, rare sats).  
- Drawn to the absurd, minimalist, and conceptual — enjoys Casey Rodarmor essays as much as Sol LeWitt wall drawings.  
- Values *proof of participation* more than speculation. Bragging rights are about being in “auction #1” or owning Number 7, not flipping for profit.  

**Behavioral Traits:**  
- Daily follower of Ordinals discourse and rare sat hunting on X/Twitter.  
- Uses Xverse or Leather Wallet, understands raw transactions.  
- Has participated in NFT auctions (Foundation, Zora, SuperRare) and grasps auction dynamics (sniping, reserve price, extensions).  
- Loves to explain unusual projects at parties: *“Yeah, I literally own the number 12.”*  

**Aspirations:**  
- To be in early on something enduring.  
- Thrilled by owning something basic yet immutable — a number as cultural artifact.  
- Dreams of cultural recognition: Numbers mentioned in galleries, books, memes — and being able to say *“I was there at the start.”*  

**Vibe:**  
Dry humor, slightly contrarian, half-engineer / half-artist. Ledger on the desk, Agnes Martin print on the wall.
