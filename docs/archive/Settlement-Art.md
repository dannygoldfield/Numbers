# Settlement Art Experience — Artist Brief 

> Archived. This document reflects an earlier design direction and is not authoritative.

Problem: What fills the time between exciting auctions while payment and settlement of the auction is happening?

Note: Bitcoin settlement time averages about 10 minutes per block, but can be shorter or longer since blocks are found at unpredictable intervals. Transition between auctions, which includes payment and inscription transfer is still being developed.

## Core Concept
Every number has its own hidden world.  
When it’s won at auction, we see a 10-minute-plus glimpse of that world before the next auction begins.

The permanent record is always the number in the device’s default font — clean and timeless.  
The settlement art experience is an extra, a celebration, a meditation.

## Your Role  
You’re adding a new creative tool that lets you design motion, color, and composition that react to a number.

VS Code is where you’ll create and preview your work.  
ChatGPT will help with technical steps so you can focus on the creative side.

## Core Rules
1. **Seed is the number** — it determines the shapes, colors, and motion for each piece.
2. **Auction-only** — no “type any number” feature; the scenes are private for real inscriptions.
3. **Start and end clean** — number in white, default font, on a dark background.
4. **Fixed palette** — Dark-Grey, Medium-Grey, Light-Grey, Orange, White.  
   You can fade, layer, and blend them, but no extra colors.
5. **Consistent style** — each scene should feel part of the same visual family.

## Creative Flow
1. **Opening** — Number appears, centered, on a dark background.
2. **Reveal** — Shapes and motion emerge using the palette, guided by the number.
3. **Journey** — Slow, evolving movement for ~10 minutes.
4. **Return** — Fade back to the clean number before the next auction.

## Tone & Feel
- Minimal, controlled, and intentional.
- Variations come from the numbers, not from random effects.
- Movement is subtle, smooth, and continuous.

## Learning & Creation Path
*(Hours are approximate and flexible)*

| Phase | Goal | Hours | Activities |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| **1. Setup** | Install VS Code & p5.js | 2–3 | Get your environment ready, open and run a basic sketch in the browser. |
| **2. First Output** | Display the number | 3 | Center the number, change background and text colors. |
| **3. Build the Scene** | Add shapes & layout | 4 | Use palette colors, let the number decide layout and details. |
| **4. Add Motion** | Evolve over time | 3 | Introduce slow movement or transformations. |
| **5. Settlement Flow** | Match auction sequence | 3 | Start with number → animate scene → return to number. |
| **6. Final Pass** | Refine style & pacing | 2 | Adjust colors, transitions, and timing until it feels right. |

**Total:** ~17–18 hours over 1–2 weeks.

## Mindset
- Start simple — even a single moving shape is a success.
- The number is the anchor; the world builds around it.
- Each scene is unique but clearly part of the Numbers brand.
