# Is this a Joke? — Numbers

Yes and no.

**Numbers** began as a joke in the ordinary sense:
an absurd question - What if you could own a number? - taken seriously.

Whether it is a joke or not: 
1. it cannot live in the system. 
2. the technology must be exact.
3. the rules must be strict.
4. the outcomes must be irreversible.

Nothing in the protocol acknowledges the joke.

The system asserts nothing beyond the outcome.
