## ✅ What I Accomplished Today & Next Steps

### 25-08-06
### Accomplished Today
1. Installed, scaffolded, configured, verified, versioned, and documented a complete frontend environment — React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite, Git.

2. Audited and restructured UI/UX tooling, making a clear strategic call (Penpot over Figma) and aligning with your project philosophy (open-source, clean workspace).

3. Stood up a doc system (mdBook) and organized your Markdown structure for versioned internal tracking — something many devs neglect until way later.


### Next Steps
1. Start mobile homepage layout design in Penpot  
2. Build components and sections using Tailwind + React  
3. Continue versioning and refining in a clean Git workspace  
4. Continue to document the system as it evolves
