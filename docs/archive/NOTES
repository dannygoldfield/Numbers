### Casey uses mdbook-i18n-helpers:
This is a collection of mdBook plugins that leverage the Gettext standard for internationalization. It includes:
mdbook-xgettext: An mdBook renderer that extracts translatable strings from your Markdown source files into a .pot (Portable Object Template) file. This file serves as the basis for creating language-specific translation files.
mdbook-gettext: An mdBook preprocessor that takes the generated .po (Portable Object) translation files and integrates them into the build process, producing translated versions of your mdBook.

### mdBook additional improvements
