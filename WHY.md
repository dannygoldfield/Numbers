# WHY: Number Theory

### 1. What if you could own a number?

Not a token, not a coin, just a number.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5…

Claimed, inscribed, and recorded one at a time.

It’s simple and odd. It’s a system.

What happens when a number becomes yours?

### 2. The Auction: A Simple Count

Anyone can join. Bidders connect through a website using secure Bitcoin wallets.

Each number is auctioned in order. Each auction lasts 12,345 seconds (3 hours and 26 minutes).

Start with 1, then 2, then 3, and so on. No skipping.

Auctions build a community, one bid at a time.

Some numbers feel personal.
Birthdays. Jersey numbers. Lucky digits.

People don’t just bid on numbers, they connect to them.

These are live public auction events. Community counts.

### 3. Artwork

A number, rendered in your device’s default font. No styling imposed. Minimal and conceptual by design.

Universally rendered, locally interpreted. What you see depends on where you see it.

There are 21 million Bitcoin. Each Bitcoin contains 100 million satoshis.

That’s 2.1 quadrillion satoshis.

Each number is inscribed on a single satoshi. Each satoshi can be tracked forever with the Ordinals Protocol.

### 4. Infrastructure

Ordinal theory uses a zero-based system (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) to map positions across a virtual grid.

Number theory uses a one-based system (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) to label what the grid holds.

Numbers name. Ordinals locate: one-based addresses on a zero-based map.

Numbers + Ordinals + Bitcoin = Identity + Position + Security

### 5. Aspiration

It is still early for Bitcoin. Anything is possible. 

Revenue from auctions can fund new tools, new ideas, new forms of infrastructure.

From the simplest count, something enduring can emerge.
