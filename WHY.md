# Why

What if you could own a number?

Not a token. Not a coin. A number. Inscribed on Bitcoin.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

One at a time. Auctioned. Written to sats. The record stays.

It’s dumb. It’s serious. It’s a system.

If it works, good. If it makes money, better. Use the money to make other stuff.

That’s it.
